  Summary:
    text: "
     The DAT file is one of the primary container formats used by the game. Contained within the DAT files are other subfiles. 
     The content of the subfiles can vary from *visual* assets such as models or textures, to more *abstract* functionality such as 
     the events that trigger in a room. The DAT file has seen a few variations between versions; 
     however, it is fairly ubiquitous and an important format. By modifying the subfiles inside of the DAT file we 
     are able to change the behaviour of the game.\n"

     Contained inside the DAT file are other sub files, each with their own purpose. Some of these subfiles are required for the room to function. Other subfiles
     are supplimentry and allow for us to use certain functionality inside the room.

     * AEV - This subfile holds room events<br>\n
     * BIN - 3D Model asset used in the room.<br>
     * BLK - Block loading, used in r002, and r100. Rooms that use this method of loading data also have supporting dat files with suffix _00x.dat<br>
     * CAM - Defines how the camera behaves in designated areas.<br>
     * CNS - Room constants<br>
     * DCT - Menu words from Mercs<br>
     * DRA - **TODO**<br>
     * DSE - Door sound effect<br>
     * EAR - **TODO**<br>
     * EAT - Bullet Collision<br>
     * EFF - Effects Package is a container used to hold the assets required for certain room effects<br>
     * EMI - **TODO**<br>
     * ESE - Environmental Sound Effects define ambient sounds such as fire, running water, etc.<br>
     * ESL - Enemy Spawn List<br>
     * ETM - Interactable Models such as movable scenery.<br>
     * ETS - **TODO**<br>

     * FCS - **TODO**<br>
     * FCV - Animation file<br>
     * FSE - Foot Sound Effect<br>
     * FNT - Font file. Defines the symbols the MDT file uses to present text to the screen.<br>
     * ITA - Positions for ITM entries<br>
     * ITM - Item definitions<br>
     * LIT - Light definitions. Works together with the CAM to light a scene.<br>
     * MDT - Message Dialog Text works together with a FNT file to create interactable dialogs on screen.<br>
     * OSD - Null file<br>
     * RTP - Route points. Path NPCs and enemies follow to navigate the room.<br>
     * SAR - **TODO**<br>
     * SAT - Room Collision<br>

     * SFD - Sofdec Video File<br>
     * SHD - Shadow Definition<br>
     * SMD - Stage Models are instanced geometry used to decorate a scene. Depending on the room there can be an accompanying BLK file used to stream SMDs from other DATs life.<br>
