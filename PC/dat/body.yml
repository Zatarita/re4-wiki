  Summary:
    text: "
     The DAT file is one of the primary container formats used by the game. Contained within the DAT files are other subfiles. 
     The content of the subfiles can vary from *visual* assets such as models or textures, to more *abstract* such as 
     defining the functionality of the objects in the room. The DAT file has seen a few variations between versions; 
     however, it is fairly ubiquitous and an important format. By modifying the subfiles inside of the DAT file we 
     are able to change the behaviour of the game.\n"
