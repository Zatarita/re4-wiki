     The DAT file is one of the primary container formats used by the game. Contained within the DAT files are other subfiles. 
     The content of the subfiles can vary from *visual* assets such as models or textures, to more *abstract* functionality such as 
     the events that trigger in a room. The DAT file has seen a few variations between versions; 
     however, it is fairly ubiquitous and an important format. By modifying the subfiles inside of the DAT file we 
     are able to change the behaviour of the game.<br><br><br><br>

    The Header of the file contains all the metadata about the file. Things such as how many subfiles are contained inside the DAT, what type
    of files they are, and where to find the data. Using this information the game navigates the dat file to load the assets needed
    for a room to function properly. <br><br><br><br><br>

     "Contained inside the DAT file are other sub files, each with their own purpose. Some of these subfiles are required for the room to function. Other subfiles
     are supplimentry and allow for us to use certain functionality inside the room.
