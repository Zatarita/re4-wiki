  Summary:
    text: "
     The MDT File is responsible for the text presented in message dialogs throughout the game. 
     These text dialogs are typically triggered by an AEV event; however, other things can trigger 
     MDTs such as cutscenes or a sequence. The MDT file can contain multiple languages inside of it.
     Each language contains a list of encoded characters that represent the text that gets presented. 
     These characters are determined by a font file. 
     Some of these characters aren't printed, but instead control *how* the text gets presented. Such as
     font color, or text justification.\n"

  Header:
   text: "
    A MDT File is a list of MDT Languages. The header consists of a count, offsets pointing to each language, 
    and then the languages themselves. Majority of the time each MDT file contains
    all the strings for each language in the game. This is not always the case though. There is a variation of the
    MDT that only contains one language. These are typically found inside folders that denote their respective language. 
    (eg *BIO4/SS/**eng***, *BIO4/SS/**jap***, etc)<br>\n
    > On update 1.10 Traditional and Simplified Chinese was added to the game. This means that later versions of the
    game have a slight altercation to the format. The update appended the two new MDT Languages to the end of the list 
    **without** updating the count. You can determine if you have a new MDT by checking if the first offset instead of using the count<br>\n

  MDT Language:
   text: "
    The MDT Language is a list of strings. 
    When working with the standard version of the MDT we see a similar structure to the header. We have a count
    denoting how many strings there are, then the offsets, and the MDT Strings. The structure of the MDT Language
    isn't fully mapped out yet though. There is an unknown at the beginning of the language that is suspected to be
    vestigial from the console ports; however, this requires confirmation.\n"

  MDT String:
   text: "
    The MDT String is a list of 16-bit numbers. These numbers either control how the text gets presented to the screen,
    or they *are* the characters that gets presented to screen. The highest 8-bits control which character gets grabbed
    from the FNT file. This is the index used to grab the font character. The Lowest 8-bits are special characters.
    There are only 18 of them; however, they control things such as the flow and presentation of the text.\n"
