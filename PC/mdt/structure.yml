 Header:
  Count:
   type: uint32_t
   comments: Count of how many languages are in the file. It is possible that this value does not equal 6. In that case The MDT only has one language inside of it and this will instead jump straight to the start of the MDT Langauge.
   default: 6
   references: {
    MDT Langauge: "#mdt-language"
   }
  Offsets:
   type: array
   subtype: uint32_t
   size: Count
   comments: Offsets pointing to the start of each language.
  Languages:
   type: array
   subtype: MDT Language
   size: Count
   comments: The actual languages themselves.
   references: {
    MDT Language: "#mdt-language-1"
   }
  Note:
   type: ""
   comments: The size of the array varries depending on version. For version 1.10+ the MDT has two extra offsets for Traditional and Simplified Chinese. These are just hacked onto the end, and the count is not adjusted to reflect that; however, Fixing the value causes the game to crash. For version 1.10 Count + 2 should be used.

 MDT Language:
  Unknown:
   type: uint32_t
   comments: Currently Unknown. Assumed vestigial data from console ports.
  Count:
   type: uint32_t
   comments: Count of how many strings are inside this particular language.
  Offsets:
   type: array
   subtype: uin32_t
   comments: Offsets pointing to the start of each string.
   size: Count
  Strings:
   type: array
   subtype: MDT String[Count]
   references: {
      MDT String: "#mdt-string"
   }

 MDT String:
  Characters:
   type: array
   subtype: short
   comments: Each string starts and ends with a Start and End character respectively. Beyond that each short is either a special character, or a reference to a character defined in a FNT file. The lower 8 bits are reserved for special characters and the upper 8 bits (128+) are indexes into a FNT file.
