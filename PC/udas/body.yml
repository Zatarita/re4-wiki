 Summary: 
  text: >
   The udas is one of the container formats used by the UHD Version of the game. It not only holds the assets required for a room to work, but it also contains files that define *how* the room works. 
   Using various tools the udas can be modified. This allows modders to be able to adjust the behavior of a room or the game as a whole. This is the primary approach used for modding the game.<br>
   The udas works by bundling together a DAT file with a SND file. The DAT file is *the* primary container format used by the game. The DAT conatined within the udas is the file that actually
   contains majority of the game assets used by a particular room. The SND file (at least in this version of the game) helps link the room's soundbanks found inside the *BIO4/snd* folder to their respective
   room. These two files work together to do majority of the heavy lifting.
