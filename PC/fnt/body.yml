    The Font file is responsible for defining the symbols that get presented to the screen for various languages.
    There can be multiple font files being used for different circumstances. This is useful for languages that contain 
    thousands of characters.\n\n

    The Font file works together with the MDT to create text dialogs for the player to interact with
    during gameplay, menus, and cutscenes.

  Header:
    text: "
    The header to a font file tells the game where to find the sprite sheet and spacing definitions. The sprite sheet
    and spacing definitions work together to define how the characters get presented to the screen. On the PC version of
    the game, for latin based languages, there also appears to be extra data in the header that has an unknown purpose.

  Font Spacing:

    The font spacing determines the margins of the font lettering. There are two bytes that determine the distance from the start
    of the sprite sheet's cell, and the length in pixels till the end of the symbol. These two pieces work together to 'cut' the symbol
    out of the sprite sheet. Typically these values add together to the full cell size. (which can varry from sprite sheet to sprite sheet)
    Though, the symbol can use less than the full cell periodically.\n<br><br><br><br><br>
