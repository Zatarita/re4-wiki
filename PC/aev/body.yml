     The AEV file is used to define actions a player can take in a room. Each action is given
     a designed trigger area. When an entity is standing in the trigger area they are able to
     interact with the event. Some events happen automatically, while others require the player to press the 
     action button to enable it. Some of the events are linked to internal functionality and thusly
     aren't easily modable. Any event falling in this category is left out until more information 
     can be found out about them.

  Trigger Volumes:

     A trigger volume is a defined area where an entity can initiate an AEV event. Each event has it's own dedicated trigger volume. These volumes have extra metadata used to define it's shape 
     and functionality. There are two primary shapes the trigger area can be, rectangular (default) and circular. When the trigger volume is rectangular the game reads 
     all four points of the rectangle (x, z), the starting Y position for all the points, and the height of the trigger area; however, when the trigger volume is circular
     the game treats the first of the four points as the center of the circle (x, z); the other 3 points are unused. Instead the radius will be used.
     This determines the size and position of the trigger area. Beyond that the Y position and height are still applied the same way as the rectangular trigger area.

     The Door event is used to transition between rooms. When activating a door event the game checks the parameters supplied. It will play a designated "Open Sound"
     from the room's sound table and attempt to load the Next Room in the Next Stage. It will then place the player in the desired Position and Facing 
     supplied in the event parameters. Some doors might be locked. In this case the event must have a lock flag assigned that signifies the current locked state of 
     the door. This is stored internally by the game. There are a maximum of 0x3f flags reserved for this purpose. They are stored along with other player information 
     during save. (Validation needed) Doors locked in this manor have a sister door that toggles the locked flag by unlocking it. typically the "other side" of the door. 
     In the event the door is unlocked. The game checks the parameters of the event to pull a sound from the room sound table for unlocking the door. Then it will toggle
     the locked flag.
